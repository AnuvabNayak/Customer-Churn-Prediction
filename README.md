# E-commerce Customer Churn Prediction

This repository contains the code and analysis for a customer churn prediction project in the e-commerce domain. The project utilizes a Random Forest Classifier model to predict account churn, enabling proactive customer retention strategies.

## Project Overview

In the competitive e-commerce landscape, customer churn poses a significant challenge. This project addresses this issue by developing a predictive model to identify at-risk customers and inform targeted interventions. The model's predictions serve as a foundation for designing and implementing proactive customer retention campaigns, tailored to the specific needs and behaviors of different customer segments.

## Key Features

*   **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Non-numeric characters and missing values were handled to ensure data quality and consistency.
*   **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Descriptive statistics, value counts, and visualizations were used to understand customer behavior and segment them into distinct groups using K-Means clustering.
*   **Model Building and Evaluation:** A Random Forest Classifier was employed for churn prediction, achieving high accuracy (99.56%) on the test set.
*   **Business Recommendations:** The project offers strategic business recommendations, balancing customer incentives and financial prudence.

## Files

*   `Customer+Churn+Data.csv`: The dataset used for analysis and model building.
